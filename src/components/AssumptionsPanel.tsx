            <li>
              Five team-defined bands map to 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100. This harmonisation introduces
              judgement; it is not a common classification published by all sources.
            </li>
            <li>
              Base weights: L 0.40 / F 0.40 / G 0.20. Coarse ground-condition evidence receives
              lower weight. Four scenarios test this assumption.
            </li>
            <li>
              Team thresholds: high ≥ 70; medium ≥ 45 and &lt; 70; monitor &lt; 45. Scores are a
              comparative index, not a flood probability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Decimal scores show arithmetic, not measurement precision. Alphabetical ordering
              resolves equal scores and must not imply meaningful separation.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 className="mt-6 text-sm font-semibold text-accent-foreground">
            Limits that affect decisions
          </h3>
          <ul className="mt-3 space-y-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            <li>
              All site scores, footprint rectangles and flood polygons are illustrative. Ground grid
              cells are synthetic; none is an authoritative source extract.
            </li>
            <li>
              Land status is not a contamination measurement. GeoSure screens natural hazards, not
              site-specific stability or every possible ground constraint.
            </li>
            <li>
              Recommendations are candidates only. Confirm permeability, groundwater, contamination,
              utilities and stability before design or construction.
            </li>
            <li>
              Intervention ratings and cost bands are team judgements, not quotations, predicted
              benefits or a validated decision matrix.
